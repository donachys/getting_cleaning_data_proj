The original data sets may be found at:

The training, test, class(y), and subject data were combined into a single data set.
The features were reduced to only include mean and standard deviation of each sensor measurement.

From there each of the first 66 columns were generated by performing a mean of the columns for each participant for each activity.

The tidy.txt data set includes a header with each of the column names.

The last two columns specify the id for the subject and the type of activity being performed.
